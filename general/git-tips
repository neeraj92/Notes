# my reference for some options in git
	-- Ignore files: 
		--- If we add regex to ~/.config/git/ignore then all files that match the regex will not be tracked in git
	
	-- Amend : 
		--- For commits that missed a file or something we can use git commit --amend to avoid having 2 different commits
		--- This doesnt work if you are making a change to the same place, like typo correction. Doing so will result in a merge conflict
