# Setting up connection to multiple servers when working
# Earlier used to create a folder with scripts using sshpass {really bad if someone has access to the machine -- exposes all password}
	
	-- Overview :
		"""
			Create ssh keys {if needed use different keys for different services like git, servers etc}
			Set up the ssh config 
			copy the keys
		"""
	
	-- Steps : 
		--- Create ssh keys : 
			ssh-keygen -t rsa
			
			Remember the passphrase used for generating the sshkeys. OS will ask permission to use the key. 
			We can create multiple key pairs by specifying the path
		
		--- Set up ssh config : 
			Reference : http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/
			
			Some important options : 
			Host <name of the server>
			  HostName <ip/url>
			  Port <22 by default / or other ports given generally for obfuscation>
			  User <username in the server>
  			IdentityFile <path to the private key generated from ssh-keygen>
				ProxyCommand <command to be run when ssh is run. Used for port forwarding etc>
		
		--- Copy the ssh keys : 
			ssh-copy-id -i <path to the public key correspinding to the private key in config>	<name of the server as provided in config>
