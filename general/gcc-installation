# Installing gcc from source 
# [1]Reference : https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-gcc-on-centos-6 // gives installation details for all the languages
# [2]Reference : https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC
	-- Pre requisite -> base g++ compiler, svn, flex {fast lexical analyser}
	-- Check the projects available from svn repo of gcc:
		--- svn ls svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags | grep gcc | grep release
	
	-- Checkout the code into desired folder :
		--- svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags/gcc_5_1_0_release/
	
	-- Install pre-requisites using the script available :
		--- ./contrib/download_prerequisites
	
	-- configure the project : 
		For options refer : https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html
		"""
			From [2] 
			First, we highly recommend that GCC be built into a separate directory from the sources which does not reside within the source tree. This is how we generally build GCC; building where srcdir == objdir should still work, but doesn't get extensive testing; building where objdir is a subdirectory of srcdir is unsupported.
		"""
		--- mkdir objdir
		--- srcdir/configure  
		--- use "--enable-languages=c,c++,fortran,go" for chosing languages needed
	
	-- make project :
		--- If you have not installed flex then build breaks {not warned in configure script}. then run make distclean and then configure again
	
	-- use sudo make install to install the compiler.
