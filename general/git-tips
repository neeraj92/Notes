# my reference for some options in git
	-- Ignore files: 
		--- If we add regex to ~/.config/git/ignore then all files that match the regex will not be tracked in git
	
	-- Amend : 
		--- For commits that missed a file or something we can use "git commit --amend" to avoid having 2 different commits
		--- This doesnt work if you are making a change to the same place, like typo correction. Doing so will result in a merge conflict

	-- Squashing : 
		--- Reference : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6934752/combining-multiple-commits-before-pushing-in-git
		--- When having multiple commits for a single task if all of the commits need not be pushed then all of them can be squashed and made into a single commit.
		--- For this if you have multiple local commits that has not been pushed then : 
				
				git rebase -i <remote>/<branch_name>  // remote is usually origin unless configured.
																							// -i will give an interactive output

				this command will open an editor with the output something like

					pick 16b5fcc Code in, tests not passing
					pick c964dea Getting closer
					pick 06cf8ee Something changed

				change it to 
					
					pick 16b5fcc Code in, tests not passing
					squash c964dea Getting closer
					squash 06cf8ee Something changed
				
				save and exit the editor. Another editor will open for the commit message
